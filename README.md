*Broken-Rust*

This respository contains examples of Rust code that, despite being written in Safe Rust, break memory safety. These examples are provided for educational purposes only. They demonstrate how Safe Rust can still lead to memory safety issues under specific circumstances. 
We recommend using a sandboxed environment to run the code to avoid any unintended side effects. Some of the code examples work on specific OS or versions of Rust. 
You can find that detail in the specific code file.
